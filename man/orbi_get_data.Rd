\description{
Retrieve a specific subset of the aggregated data into a single data frame by specifying which columns to take from each dataset (file_info, scans, peaks, etc.) using \code{\link[dplyr:select]{dplyr::select()}} syntax. If data from more than one dataset is selected (e.g. some columns from \code{scans} AND some from \code{peaks}), the datasets are combined with an \code{\link[dplyr:mutate-joins]{dplyr::inner_join()}} using the columns listed in \code{by} (only the ones actually in the datasets). Joins that would lead to duplicated data entries (i.e. many-to-many joins) are not allowed and will throw an error to avoid unexpected replications of individual datapoints. If you really want to do such a join, you'll have to do it manually.
