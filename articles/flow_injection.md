## Data

### Load raw file(s)

``` r
# read raw files including 1 spectrum
raw_files <-
  c("ac5.RAW", "ac6.RAW", "s3744.RAW") |>
  orbi_get_example_files() |>
  orbi_read_raw(include_spectra = 100) |>
  orbi_aggregate_raw()
```

``` fansi
✔ [269ms] orbi_read_raw() read ac5.RAW from cache, included the spectrum from 1
scan
```

``` fansi
✔ [101ms] orbi_read_raw() read ac6.RAW from cache, included the spectrum from 1
scan
```

``` fansi
✔ [82ms] orbi_read_raw() read s3744.RAW from cache, included the spectrum from
1 scan
```

``` fansi
✔ [584ms] orbi_read_raw() finished reading 3 files
```

``` fansi
✔ [860ms] orbi_aggregate_raw() aggregated file_info (3), scans (16.63k), peaks
(514.98k), and spectra (1.98k) from 3 files using the standard aggregator
```

``` r
# quick glance at the spectra (m/z range 96 to 102)
raw_files |> orbi_plot_spectra(96, 102)
```

![One spectrum from each file with the M+x regions

One spectrum from each file with the M+x regions highlighted.

### Identify isotopocules

``` r
# identify sulfate isotopocules
# could come from a tsv, csv, or xlsx spreadsheet instead
isotopocules <- tibble(
  compound = "HSO4-",
  isotopocule = c(
    "M0", "33S", "17O", "34S", "18O", 
    # also look for a few clumped isotopocules
    "33S18O", "34S17O", "36S", "18O18O"),
  mass = c(
    96.96000, 97.95940, 97.96420, 98.95580, 98.96430, 
    99.9632, 99.9590, 100.9551, 100.968046)
)

  # disregard unidentified isotopocules but keep missing
  orbi_filter_isotopocules(keep_missing = TRUE) |>
  # check for minor peaks that are in the same mass tolerance
  # window of an isotopocule 
  orbi_flag_satellite_peaks()
```

``` fansi
! [3.7s] orbi_identify_isotopocules() identified 84.85k/514.98k peaks (16%)
representing 94% of the total ion current (TIC) as isotopocules M0, 33S, 17O,
34S, 18O, 36S, 33S18O, 34S17O, and 18O18O using the default_tolerance of 1
mmu but encountered 1 warning
  → ! isotopocules M0, 33S, 17O, 34S, 18O, 33S18O, 34S17O, 36S, and 18O18O are
  missing from some scans (64.84k missing peaks in total) - make sure to
  evaluate coverage with e.g. orbi_plot_isotopocule_coverage()
```

``` fansi
✔ [14ms] orbi_filter_isotopocules() removed 430.13k / 579.82k peaks (74%)
because they were unidentified peaks (430.13k). Remaining isotopocules: M0,
33S, 17O, 34S, 18O, 34S17O, 33S18O, 36S, and 18O18O.
```

``` fansi
✔ [2.6s] orbi_flag_satellite_peaks() confirmed there are no satellite peaks

## Processing

It’s clear from the plots above that we don’t have good coverage for the
clumped isotopocules and 36S (i.e. they are missing from some/many
scans). We won’t work with these further anyways but it’s a good visual
example of how much harder these are to detect.

``` r
# Preprocess data (this is exactly the same as with an isox file)
data <- 
  raw_files_w_isotopocules |>
  # focus on the main single substitutions
  orbi_filter_isotopocules(c("M0", "33S", "17O", "34S", "18O")) |>
  # double check the remainng isotopcoules
  orbi_flag_weak_isotopocules(min_percent = 99) |> 
  # flags outlying scans that have more than 2 times or less than
  # 1/2 times the average number of ions in the Orbitrap analyzer
  orbi_flag_outliers(agc_fold_cutoff = 2) |>
  # sets one isotopocule in the dataset as the base peak
  # (denominator) for ratio calculation
  orbi_define_basepeak(basepeak_def = "M0") 
```

``` fansi
✔ [25ms] orbi_filter_isotopocules() removed 66.66k / 149.69k peaks (45%)
because they were missing isotopocules (64.84k), or not the selected
isotopocule M0, 33S, 17O, 34S, and 18O (1.82k).
```

``` fansi
✔ [43ms] orbi_flag_weak_isotopocules() confirmed there are no weak
isotopocules: all are detected in at least 99% of scans in each of the 15 data
groups (based on uidx, compound, and isotopocule)
```

``` fansi
✔ [26ms] orbi_flag_outliers() flagged 44/16632 scans (0.26%) as outliers based
on 2 fold AGC cutoff, i.e. based on scans below 1/2 and above 2 times the
average number of ions tic * it.ms in the Orbitrap analyzer, in 3 data groups
(based on uidx) → use orbi_plot_raw_data(y = tic * it.ms) to visualize them
```

``` fansi
✔ [2.1s] orbi_define_basepeak() set M0 as the ratio denominator and calculated
66.40k ratio values for 4 isotopocules (33S, 17O, 34S, and 18O)
```

Let’s take a look at the AGC cutoff flagged samples

``` r
# in terms of scans
orbi_plot_raw_data(data, y = tic * it.ms, y_scale = "log")
```

Isotopocules ions

Seems like the issue is mostly towards the end of the s3744 analysis.
What about the resulting ratios?

``` r
data |> orbi_plot_raw_data(y = ratio) 
```

![Isotopocule ratios vs
M0](flow_injection_files/figure-html/fig-ratios-1.png)

Isotopocule ratios vs M0

The ratios suggest that there really is an issue at the end of the s3744
run. Having flagged these outliers, they will automatically not be
included in the summary calculation of the resulting ratios.

## Summary

``` r
# summarize the ratio summaries
data_summary <- 
  data |>
  orbi_summarize_results(ratio_method = "sum")
```

``` fansi
✔ [94ms] orbi_summarize_results() summarized ratios from 66.33k peak (excluding
68 flagged peaks; excluding 0 unused peaks) using the sum method and grouping
the data by uidx, filename, compound, basepeak, and isotopocule
```

``` r
# data
data_summary |>
  orbi_get_data(summary = c("compound", "isotopocule", starts_with("ratio")))
```

``` fansi
✔ [9ms] orbi_get_data() retrieved 12 records from the combination of file_info
(3) and summary (12) via uidx
